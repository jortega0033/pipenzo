// AD-09: this used to also re-export process/* internals, both providers' build-args, and both
// real providers' capabilities objects, none of which any consumer outside this package (or its
// own tests, which import them by relative path) actually used, and docs/protocol-v1.md already
// (incorrectly) claimed build-args was unexported. Trimmed to what apps/daemon genuinely needs,
// so the documented "internal" surface is actually internal rather than merely undocumented.
