 * What this adapter actually implements for Claude Code, see the parser and adapter.ts for the

 *
 * - resume: `--resume <providerSessionId>` (adapter.ts)
 * - cancellation: shared runProviderSession() process-tree kill (providers/common/run-session.ts)
 * - tools: `tool_use`/`tool_result` content blocks normalize to tool.started/tool.completed (parser.ts)
 * - usage: `message.usage` and the final `result` event's usage normalize to `usage` events (parser.ts)
 * - thinking: `thinking` content blocks normalize to thinking.delta (parser.ts); only present when
 *   the CLI itself surfaces extended-thinking output; absent otherwise, which is fine, since this
 *   capability means "the adapter passes it through when the CLI provides it", not "always present"
