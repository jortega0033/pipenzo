# Capability and security model for protocol v2

- **Status:** partially implemented. The v2 contract, negotiation, routes/client, durable
  session/history store, workspace trust store, interactive supervisor, approval audit, Claude Agent
  SDK and Codex app-server transports, and renderer are implemented. Broad OS-isolation guarantees,
  complete MCP/component/subagent controls, and provider-executed attachment/structured-output flows
  are not complete.
- **Decision date:** 2026-08-30
- **Applies to:** the current `/v2` protocol and rich Claude/Codex transports
- **Keeps compatible:** protocol v1 route and event shapes; current production v1 starts also use
  the shared workspace-trust admission gate described below

This document fixes the capability vocabulary and security decisions for protocol v2, provider,
persistence, and desktop work. Status statements below distinguish implemented controls from design
requirements that are not yet enforced. [Protocol v1](protocol-v1.md) remains the authoritative
description of the unversioned v1 application.

## Decision summary

1. A capability is advertised only from adapter evidence, never from a provider feature page.
2. Capability support is scoped to provider, transport, version, platform, model, authentication
   mode, and workspace trust state. Support in one scope says nothing about another.
3. Unknown capability IDs survive validation, but remain unselected by default. Core code never
   adds a provider-ID branch to interpret them.
4. A workspace is untrusted until the user explicitly trusts its canonical repository identity.
   Project instructions and executable configuration are suppressed while it is untrusted.
5. An untrusted workspace runs only when the selected transport can prove the required restricted
   profile. An unverified permission mode is not a sandbox.
6. AgentDock has no provider, cloud, or MCP credential store and never collects designated
   authentication values through its API or UI. Adapters may pass approved inherited values
   opaquely to provider transports, but never persist or render them.
7. Persisted data is allowlisted, bounded, and redacted. Raw provider
   frames, reasoning, process environments, designated authentication data, and unrestricted tool
   payloads are not persisted. User text and selected files can still contain user-supplied secrets.
8. An interactive provider action is allowed only after its approval audit record is durable.
   Failure, timeout, disconnection, or ambiguity denies the action. If the audit write itself fails,
   AgentDock still forwards a provider-native deny and reports `audit_failure`; it does not cancel
   the session solely for that failure. The standalone MCP invocation route does not currently make
   this audited-approval guarantee.
9. A transport may fall back only before its exact accepted-work boundary. Work that may have
   started is never replayed through another transport.
10. Resume and fork use stored provider-native identifiers. Fork is never simulated by replaying a
    transcript, and dirty worktrees are never removed automatically.

The current implementation is stricter than decision 5: it rejects every untrusted session start.
Running an untrusted workspace under a proven restricted profile remains a design target, not a
shipped capability.

## Compatibility boundary

| Agent isolation    | Provider-owned behavior, not attested by AgentDock                                                 | Policy/sandbox state is reported conservatively; broad platform-specific guarantees remain incomplete |
| History            | Event replay remains memory-only; compatibility metadata omits prompts and raw error diagnostics   | Durable normalized history, pagination, whole-lineage deletion, and bounded retention are implemented |
| Credentials        | Full daemon environment inherited by the CLI; CLI owns login                                       | No credential vault; rich transports use transport-specific eligibility and environment behavior      |
| Approval/audit     | Provider-owned, with no AgentDock approval channel or audit                                        | Interactive approvals are correlated and durably audited before allow; standalone MCP invoke is not   |

Protocol v1 keeps its original request/event shapes and has no trust-management routes, approval
channel, durable event history, or sandbox claims. The production daemon nevertheless requires the
current workspace incarnation to be trusted before either a v1 or v2 start; callers manage that
state through `/v2/workspaces`. V2 owns the remaining security controls. A validated session
snapshot may expose `providerSessionId`, but create/resume/fork requests never accept a
renderer-supplied provider-native continuation ID.

## Capability vocabulary

### Owners

Every catalog entry has exactly one semantic owner:

- `provider`: the adapter must map and prove a provider-native behavior.
- `agentdock`: AgentDock implements the behavior independently of provider feature claims.
- `composite`: a provider-native behavior is usable only through an AgentDock policy, correlation,
  or lifecycle layer. Neither side alone satisfies the capability.

Owner does not grant permission. Every provider-owned capability still passes through AgentDock's
normal validation and policy boundaries.

### Support records

The v2 runtime represents support with this logical shape. The implementation may use equivalent
TypeScript names, but it must preserve these fields and meanings.

```ts
type CapabilityKind = 'operation' | 'observation' | 'guarantee';
type Effect =
  'read' | 'filesystem_write' | 'command' | 'network' | 'external_side_effect' | 'destructive';

type CapabilitySupportRecord = {
  id: string;
  kind: CapabilityKind;
  owner: 'provider' | 'agentdock' | 'composite';
  support: 'supported' | 'unsupported' | 'unknown';
  stability: 'stable' | 'experimental' | 'deprecated';
  evidence: Array<{
    kind: 'fixture' | 'host_verified' | 'runtime_report' | 'vendor_declared';
    reference: string;
    verifiedAt?: string;
  }>;
  scope: {
    provider: string;
    transport: string;
    platform: 'win32' | 'darwin' | 'linux' | 'linux_wsl2';
    model: string | '*';
    authMode: string | '*';
    trustState: 'untrusted' | 'trusted';
    versions: {
      adapterContract: string;
      transport: string;
      runtime: string;
      sdk?: string;
      schema?: string;
      fixtureSet: string;
    };
  };
  prerequisites: {
    capabilities: string[];
    trustStates: Array<'untrusted' | 'trusted'>;
    sessionStates: Array<'starting' | 'active' | 'idle' | 'terminal'>;
    services: Array<
      | 'approval_responder'
      | 'question_responder'
      | 'audit_store'
      | 'attachment_store'
      | 'history_store'
      | 'workspace_lease'
    >;
  };
  possibleEffects: Effect[];
  effectsComplete: boolean;
  constraints: WireCapabilityConstraints;
  reason?: string;
};
```

`CapabilityConstraints` is the following complete ID-keyed union. A runtime validator must pair a
core support record's `id` with exactly the mapped schema; core IDs never use arbitrary JSON.

Omitting request constraints never means unlimited. It deterministically selects these canonical
defaults clipped to the advertised record: text uses 200,000 characters with no attachments;
acknowledgement uses 30 seconds; interaction uses 5 minutes/32 KiB; content uses 256 KiB and
`live_only`; usage accepts advertised scopes; cost accepts advertised currencies/scopes but not
estimates; catalogs use 50 entries; MCP inspection uses stable advertised transports but excludes
legacy SSE; MCP connection permits `connect` but not `reconnect`; MCP configuration and
skill/plugin/hook management permit `disable` only; invocation/effect operations allow `read` only;
attachments use advertised MIME types and the per-file cap; structured output uses 64 KiB/depth
16/1,024 nodes; worktree/filesystem roots use only the selected daemon-issued workspace root handle;
network destinations are empty; and `NoConstraints` is exactly `{ kind: 'none' }`. A caller must
explicitly request `reconnect`, `add`, `edit`, `enable`, `remove`, or any other wider subset.

Integers are finite and non-negative. Runtime schemas apply these absolute bounds: text 200,000
characters; acknowledgement 30 seconds; interaction 5 minutes and 32 KiB; content 256 KiB; catalog
pages 1-100; attachment bytes no greater than the retention cap; schema 64 KiB/depth 16/1,024 nodes;
at most 32 unique MIME types, currencies, root handles, or destinations; and every identifier/string
at most 256 UTF-8 bytes unless the live-bound table is narrower. Hosts are canonical IDNA names,
ports are 1-65,535, and root handles are daemon-issued, not paths.

Intersection is mechanical: numeric maxima use the lower value; allowlist/set fields use canonical
set intersection; `acceptsEstimates` uses logical AND; fixed discriminants and `native: true` must
match; destinations match canonical host/protocol/port; and persistence chooses the least revealing
common mode (`live_only` before `safe_summary` before `normalized`). An empty `attachmentKinds`
means text-only, an empty network `destinations` means deny all, and empty filesystem `rootHandles`
means no filesystem access; those are valid restrictive results. Empty transports, actions, usage
scopes, currencies, MIME types, invocation/effect sets, or worktree roots make that capability
unavailable. Invalid intersections are always unavailable. Duplicate entries are rejected before
intersection.

Known core IDs require their mapped constraint and reject `kind: 'opaque'`. Unknown well-formed IDs
round-trip only with `OpaqueCapabilityConstraints`, whose value is limited to 64 KiB, depth 16,
1,024 aggregate keys/items, finite numbers, and 256-byte keys/strings. It remains unselected unless
a fixture-backed installed consumer registers both its runtime schema and deterministic intersector;
otherwise optional is unavailable and required returns `422`.

Only `fixture` and `host_verified` evidence may form the static basis for
`support: 'supported'`. Multiple evidence entries are expected: for example, a schema fixture can
prove decoding while a platform fixture proves cancellation or sandbox enforcement. A
`runtime_report` is an observation that may narrow a matching supported record to `unsupported` or
`unknown`; it cannot promote untested support. `vendor_declared` is planning evidence only.

Catalog metadata for reserved IDs, including kind, owner, meaning, and safe default, is
authoritative. A provider manifest cannot redefine it. Records must be unique by ID and full scope;
duplicates fail manifest validation. Scope resolution follows these deterministic rules:

1. Provider, transport, platform, trust state, and every version field must match. Version ranges
   are allowed only in a checked-in compatibility manifest tied to the named fixture set.
2. Exact model/auth matches beat `*`; a narrower compatible version range beats a broader one.
3. A current runtime disable or failed host probe overrides static support.
4. Conflicting records at equal specificity resolve to `unknown`, never to supported.
5. Missing, stale, ambiguous, or version-mismatched evidence resolves to `unknown`.

`stability` describes the scoped provider implementation. The canonical AgentDock IDs and meanings
in the catalog below are stable. An adapter may advertise a catalog ID as experimental, in which
case negotiation requires both an explicit request and an experimental opt-in.

### Deterministic negotiation

```ts
type CapabilityRequest = {
  required: Array<{
    id: string;
    constraints?: WireCapabilityConstraints;
    allowExperimental?: boolean;
  }>;
  optional: Array<{
    id: string;
    constraints?: WireCapabilityConstraints;
    allowExperimental?: boolean;
  }>;
  preferredTransport?: string;
  allowExperimental: boolean; // defaults to false
};

type CapabilitySelection = {
  transport: string;
  enabled: Array<{ id: string; constraints: WireCapabilityConstraints }>;
  unavailableOptional: Array<{ id: string; reason: string }>;
  possibleEffects: Effect[];
  effectsComplete: boolean;
};
```

Each provider manifest orders transports with a fixture-tested integer priority. Negotiation:

1. Filters records to the exact runtime scope and expands the typed capability-prerequisite closure.
   A missing prerequisite removes an optional capability and fails a required one. Cycles invalidate
   the manifest.
2. Excludes deprecated support and excludes experimental support unless both the requested item and
   request opt in. An unsupported or unknown required ID returns `422` before dispatch.
3. Intersects requested and advertised typed constraints. Field-specific empty-set semantics above
   decide whether an empty result is restrictive or unavailable.
4. Uses an eligible `preferredTransport`; otherwise chooses the lowest manifest priority, then the
   lexical transport ID as a stable tie-breaker. No provider-specific daemon branch participates.
5. Returns the complete prerequisite closure and unavailable optional reasons. Selection is frozen
   for a session; a runtime downgrade before dispatch renegotiates, while one after dispatch ends
   the session without replay.

The default request preserves today's one-shot behavior: initial text and terminal lifecycle are
baseline, `session.cancel` is required, and `content.tools`, `content.usage.tokens`,
`content.usage.cost`, and `content.thinking` are optional observations. It requests no follow-up,
steering, approval, question, MCP, extension execution, subagent control, attachment, structured
output, or isolation guarantee, and it does not opt into experimental support.

Selection has different effects by kind:

- An unselected `operation` is rejected before it reaches a provider.
- An unselected `guarantee` is never displayed or used for policy.
- A provider may still emit an unselected observation. The adapter converts it to a bounded generic
  extension summary and records capability drift; it does not crash, disappear, or silently become
  a selected typed event.
- If a provider initiates an unselected approval, question, or MCP elicitation despite negotiation,
  AgentDock immediately denies/cancels it at the adapter, records capability drift, and never exposes
  the unauthorized interaction to the renderer. Inability to send a safe negative response cancels
  the turn/session.

Before dispatch, AgentDock unions `possibleEffects` across the selected transport, capabilities,
and enabled tool catalog. If any source has `effectsComplete: false`, or a possible effect is
unknown, the session is classified mutation-capable and destructive and needs an exclusive
workspace lease. Effects learned from emitted activity are too late to choose a safe lease.

### Unknown IDs and extensions

Core IDs use lowercase dotted segments, with snake case inside a segment. The `session`,
`interaction`, `content`, `model`, `integration`, `agents`, `input`, `output`, `workspace`, and
`isolation` prefixes are reserved by AgentDock. Third-party IDs use `ext.<namespace>.<feature>`.

- Schemas preserve unknown, well-formed IDs and their bounded support metadata.
- Unknown optional IDs remain visible for diagnostics and are not selected.
- Unknown required IDs return `422` before provider dispatch.
- No unknown capability implies a permission, sandbox, trust, or persistence grant.
- Negotiation compares opaque IDs and scoped records. It never switches on provider ID.

The protocol always includes validated session start/status, initial text input, text messages,
errors, and exactly one terminal event. Those baseline semantics are not optional capabilities.

Tool names are data, not capability IDs. Every tool activity descriptor carries zero or more
normalized effects: `read`, `filesystem_write`, `command`, `network`, `external_side_effect`, and
`destructive`. Missing or unknown effects are treated as both mutation-capable and destructive
until a fixture-backed adapter classification proves otherwise.

## Evidence matrix

### Current adapter-tested behavior

The test suite covers the v1 boolean contract; v2 schemas, negotiation, routes, client, supervisor,
and stores; replay fixtures; and the native rich transports. The `legacy-one-shot` bridge creates
conservative v2 support records from existing adapter booleans only when the detected version has a
matching replay fixture. Production Claude and Codex may use that bridge, or advertise their pinned
native transport when its exact eligibility checks pass. `FakeProvider` supplies deterministic
interactive conformance scenarios.

| V1 key         | Claude CLI adapter | Codex exec adapter | Closest v2 meaning                                         |
| -------------- | -----------------: | -----------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resume`       |             Tested |             Tested | `session.resume`                                           |
| `cancellation` |             Tested |             Tested | `session.cancel`                                           |
| `tools`        |             Tested |             Tested | `content.tools`, observation only                          |
| `usage`        |             Tested |             Tested | `content.usage.tokens`; cost needs separate v2 evidence    |
| `thinking`     |             Tested |             Tested | `content.thinking`, only when the CLI emits public content |

`resume`'s "Tested" column means only that the v1 CLI flag itself works when the caller already
holds a real provider-native id (`claude --resume <id>` / `codex exec resume <id>`) — a renderer-
supplied, daemon-unverified value the daemon has never bound to any lineage, matching v1's
long-standing "no daemon-side verification" contract (see [Protocol v1](protocol-v1.md)). It does
**not** mean the `legacy-one-shot` bridge advertises `session.resume` as `'supported'` at v2: that
bridge additionally requires durable, non-secret account/model binding evidence before a v2 client
can ever negotiate continuation, which no current Claude detection path supplies (issue #54) — so
Claude's `session.resume`/`session.fork` v2 records are always `'unsupported'`, with the same
"cannot yet be bound to a non-secret account and model scope" reason the Claude Agent SDK transport
already gives (`providers/claude/sdk-support.ts`), regardless of this `resume: Tested` v1 row.
Codex's v1 `resume` flag being genuinely testable is unaffected and continues to drive its own v2
`session.resume` record the same as before.

The shared provider contract and compatibility fixtures verify normalization and lifecycle. A
generic Codex `mcp_tool_call` becoming `tool.started` does not prove MCP discovery, management,
OAuth, elicitation, or approval capabilities.

### Current transport evidence

| Transport                                | Exact implemented scope                                                                                                          | Compatibility evidence                                                                                    |

| Codex app-server  | codex-cli 0.147.0, authenticated provider, trusted workspace; exact stable method allowlist                                      | Checked-in generated schema and hash, compatibility manifest, scope tests, and live fake JSON-RPC harness |
| Fake interactive  | Deterministic test-only transport                                                                                                | Sanitized interactive replay fixtures and supervisor/route tests                                          |

Each adapter compatibility record pins the exact provider/SDK version and evidence set it supports.
Vendor documentation or runtime self-report alone never widens that range. A normalized legacy tool
event still does not prove MCP discovery, management, OAuth, elicitation, or approval support.

The Electron renderer's `sandbox: true` is a Chromium renderer control. It is unrelated to whether
a Claude/Codex tool command is isolated from the host filesystem or network.

## Workspace trust

### Identity and states

For Git, trust is keyed by the tuple of daemon-resolved canonical Git common-directory and worktree
root plus each directory's persistent filesystem object identity/repository incarnation. Outside
Git it uses the canonical working directory plus its object identity. On Unix the identity includes
device/inode; on Windows it includes volume and file ID. Resolution handles symlinks, junctions,
Windows case, and equivalent paths before lookup. Renderer path text is never the trust key.

Every lookup revalidates the stored incarnation. Deleting/recreating either directory, replacing a
repository at the same path, an identity mismatch, or inability to prove a stable identity
invalidates the stored grant. A filesystem without stable object IDs gets no reusable persistent
grant; the user must explicitly trust the resolved incarnation again.

Trust never propagates automatically between linked worktrees, branches checked out at another
root, or a recreated directory. An AgentDock-created worktree starts untrusted. Its creation flow
may offer a separate explicit trust decision only after showing the source revision and every
ignored/untracked file proposed for copy.

| State       | Entry                                                                | Project-controlled behavior                                                         | Session eligibility                                                                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `untrusted` | Default for every new identity, moved repository, or unresolved path | Inspectable as inert metadata where safe; never loaded or executed                  | Design target: only a proven restricted profile may start; the current daemon rejects every untrusted start |
| `trusted`   | Explicit user grant or managed policy for the canonical identity     | May load through the owning provider, still subject to sandbox, approval, and audit | New sessions may request trusted capabilities                                                               |

A trust grant affects only new sessions; AgentDock never upgrades the permissions, configuration
sources, or sandbox of an already running provider process. Revocation is fail-closed: the daemon
atomically blocks new commands and continuations for that workspace, denies/cancels pending
interactions, and cancels every active trusted session before recording the workspace untrusted.
Selecting a directory is not a trust grant.

### Configuration source gates

| Source scope                        | Untrusted                                                                                                                                                          | Trusted                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Provider built-ins                  | Load only the fixture-backed core and read-only tool subset required by the selected profile                                                                       | Load selected supported built-ins under normal policy                                |
| Managed                             | Apply non-executable restrictions. Managed hooks/MCP/plugins/helpers execute only with an explicit managed `allow_untrusted` attestation understood by the adapter | Apply managed restrictions and explicitly enabled managed components                 |
| User                                | Auth state and non-executable restrictions may load. User hooks, MCP, plugins, skills, commands, agents, and memory stay disabled                                  | Load through documented provider rules, still subject to capability selection/policy |
| Project                             | Suppress instructions/memory, settings/env, MCP, hooks, plugins, skills, commands, and agents                                                                      | Load only after trust through documented provider rules                              |
| Local project overrides             | Suppress completely                                                                                                                                                | Load only after trust; never treat “not committed” as safer                          |
| Provider-owned session/memory state | Auth may be consulted; no prior transcript/memory enters context except an explicit trust-compatible resume                                                        | Explicit resume/memory behavior follows provider and retention policy                |
| Marketplace/imported content        | Inert metadata only; never install, enable, or execute                                                                                                             | Installed content requires component preview and supported explicit enable           |

Inspection must not connect a server, launch a helper, evaluate a manifest, or execute a hook.
Worktree include/copy rules are ignored before trust; after trust, AgentDock previews ignored files
and possible secrets before copying. A transport must report which sources it loaded. If it cannot
suppress the disallowed scopes above, it cannot run an untrusted workspace.

For Claude SDK sessions, the restricted profile requires `settingSources: []`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1`, `strictMcpConfig: true`, an isolated or relocated
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, and no configured plugins, skills, hooks, agents, or MCP servers. It pins an
exact embedded Claude Code version (`CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION`, currently `2.1.260`) --
not a minimum -- and rejects any other version outright as an SDK executable mismatch, rather than
running with reduced confidence. 2.1.246 was the version that introduced source exclusion also
ignoring the excluded source's sandbox filesystem and Edit/Read permission entries; the pinned
version is newer and keeps that property. Managed settings and provider-owned state remain
separately classified and must still satisfy the source matrix.

`allowedTools` alone is not a tool allowlist and can bypass `canUseTool` for a matching tool. The
restricted profile therefore supplies an explicit bounded `tools` set and denies every other tool
with `disallowedTools` (`Bash`, `Agent`, `Skill`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`). Canonical-path
enforcement for the file tools that remain is a `canUseTool` callback, not a `PreToolUse` hook (the
restricted profile registers no hooks at all): it resolves the real path with `realpath` and denies
anything that escapes the trusted workspace root before the tool ever runs. Escape fixtures must
prove that project instructions, environment blocks,
auto-memory, path traversal, symlink traversal, MCP, hooks, plugins, skills, agents, and helpers
cannot load or execute. A CLI flag that merely reduces features is not proof. See
[Claude Code permissions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions) and
[Agent SDK setting sources](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/claude-code-features).

Claude Bash is disabled for an untrusted session unless its sandbox filesystem policy is default
deny, allowlists reads only to the canonical workspace and minimal non-content runtime roots, denies
all writes, blocks path/symlink escape, and passes host fixtures. Claude's default Bash sandbox can
read beyond the workspace and can write the working directory, so merely initializing that sandbox
proves neither `isolation.filesystem.workspace_read` nor `isolation.filesystem.read_only`.

For Codex app-server, `trust_level = "untrusted"` suppresses project `.codex/` configuration but
does not prove that repository `AGENTS.md` instructions are suppressed. App-server is therefore
unsupported for untrusted execution until a versioned fixture proves that all project instructions
and sources in the matrix above are excluded. See the
[Codex configuration reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference) and
[AGENTS.md guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md).

## Permission, isolation, and worktree states are separate

| State                    | Question answered                                               | Never implies                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AgentDock approval       | Did the user allow this normalized action?                      | That the OS can contain it                                      |
| Provider permission mode | Will the provider ask or allow its native tool?                 | That AgentDock audited it or that every subprocess is contained |
| OS sandbox state         | What filesystem/network access can the process actually obtain? | That a destructive action is intended or approved               |
| Worktree/lease state     | Which checkout may this execution mutate?                       | Filesystem or network containment outside that path             |

Default effect policy:

| Effect                         | Untrusted workspace                           | Trusted workspace                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read inside selected workspace | Allow only under verified read-only isolation | Allow under selected isolation policy                                            |
| Filesystem write               | Deny                                          | Ask; exact session grant may be offered for a bounded root                       |
| Shell/command                  | Deny                                          | Ask with command, cwd, and effects visible                                       |
| Network                        | Deny                                          | Ask for exact host, protocol, and port; no generic shell approval substitute     |
| External side effect           | Deny                                          | Ask every time unless a later policy explicitly defines a narrower durable grant |
| Destructive or unknown         | Deny                                          | `allow_once` only; audit must succeed before forwarding                          |

Mutation-capable and unknown-effect sessions require an exclusive lease on the canonical
repository/worktree path before dispatch. Read-only sessions may share only when read-only
enforcement is proven.

## Sandbox truth model

### Reported states

- `enforced`: the exact requested profile was accepted and positively verified for this scoped
  transport/platform. This is the only state that receives a sandboxed badge.
- `provider_managed`: the provider may apply controls, but AgentDock did not configure or attest
  them. No sandboxed badge.
- `not_requested`: a trusted compatibility run intentionally requested no AgentDock isolation. No
  sandboxed badge.
- `unavailable`: the transport/platform cannot provide the requested isolation.
- `failed`: isolation was required but setup or verification failed. The session does not start.
- `unknown`: evidence is missing, stale, or ambiguous. Treat as unsupported for untrusted work.

Isolation evidence is recorded per enabled execution surface, with mechanism
`os_sandbox | provider_policy | agentdock_policy`, rather than as one provider-wide boolean:

| Surface                                                                 | Untrusted read-only requirement                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Shell commands and child processes                                      | Disabled, or OS sandbox proves workspace read-only and network mode `deny`; unsandboxed retry disabled       |
| Provider Read/Glob/Grep-style tools                                     | Provider policy limits reads to canonical workspace and explicit safe runtime paths                          |
| Provider Edit/Write/file-change tools                                   | Disabled                                                                                                     |
| MCP, hooks, plugins, skills, commands, and agent/subagent launch        | Disabled unless the source matrix has an explicit managed untrusted attestation and every effect is enforced |
| Computer use, browser control, external side effects, and unknown tools | Disabled                                                                                                     |

`isolation.filesystem.workspace_read`, `isolation.filesystem.read_only`, or
`isolation.network.restricted` may be selected only when every enabled surface satisfies that exact
guarantee. Provider/AgentDock policy can contribute to a composite restricted profile, but only
OS-enforced surfaces may receive an **OS sandboxed** badge. A policy-only session is labeled
**Restricted by policy**, never **Sandboxed**. A partial surface is shown explicitly, for example
**Bash sandboxed; file tools disabled**.

Codex restricted manifests omit or deny `thread/shellCommand` and experimental `process/spawn`:
both execute outside the thread sandbox. On native Windows, evidence records the exact `elevated`
or weaker `unelevated` sandbox mechanism. Neither state silently substitutes for the other, and an
`unelevated` result cannot satisfy a network-restricted claim without its own passing fixture. See
[Codex app-server](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server) and
[Codex Windows sandboxing](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/windows/windows-sandbox).

Claude's vendor sandbox covers Bash subprocesses, not every Read/Edit/Write or computer-use path,
and is supported on macOS, Linux, and WSL2 rather than native Windows. The current AgentDock SDK
scope disables Bash instead of claiming that sandbox. See
[Claude Code sandboxing](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing). Codex app-server accepts an
explicit turn sandbox policy, but requesting `workspace-write` is not proof of an OS-enforced
boundary; AgentDock needs versioned host evidence before reporting `enforced`. See
[Codex app-server](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server).

## Credentials and OAuth

- AgentDock has no dedicated provider/cloud/MCP credential fields, credential database, keychain
  entries, token callback, or secret-returning API in v2. User text and selected files can still
  contain pasted secrets; AgentDock cannot reliably detect or promise to redact those values.
- Renderer input can never supply a process environment or designated authentication value. UI/API
  output contains only a non-secret source label: `chatgpt`, `api_key`, `claude_subscription`,
  `bedrock`, `vertex`, `foundry`, or `unknown`.
- Environment handling is transport-specific. The Claude Agent SDK child receives an allowlisted
  environment for its reviewed auth source; Codex app-server and the legacy one-shot CLI paths
  currently inherit the daemon's full process environment. Renderer requests cannot widen or
  replace it. AgentDock does not return environment values through provider status, events, audit,
  fixtures, or logs; forks that need a narrower Codex/legacy boundary must launch the daemon with a
  minimal environment or implement explicit filtering.
- A Claude session that inherits authentication values sets
  `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB=1`. Bash, hooks, and stdio MCP remain unsupported unless fixtures
  prove their children receive no auth values and cannot read provider/cloud credential files;
  credential paths are denied or masked where the platform permits.
- Claude Agent SDK eligibility is limited to a user-provided Anthropic API key or supported
  Bedrock, Vertex, or Foundry configuration. AgentDock does not embed Claude.ai login or route
  Free/Pro/Max credentials through the SDK. Subscription login remains available only through the
  unmodified, provider-owned Claude Code CLI flow. See
  [Anthropic's authentication and credential-use policy](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance#authentication-and-credential-use).
- The Claude SDK integration is available in `auto` mode and is a pinned runtime dependency. Windows
  packaging stages its matching Claude executable and notices outside ASAR. Release changes still
  require review of then-current Anthropic distribution, authentication, and branding terms.
- Codex login remains owned by the installed Codex runtime. AgentDock may use existing
  runtime-owned authentication and expose browser/device login status, but it must not expose
  app-server `account/login/start` with `type: "apiKey"` or experimental
  `type: "chatgptAuthTokens"`; both pass secrets through the client. See
  [Codex app-server authentication](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server#authentication).
- `integration.mcp.oauth` is eligible only when a provider-owned CLI/runtime exposes a token-opaque
  URL/status flow. MCP OAuth is initiated only by explicit user action; Electron main opens a
  validated `https` URL; the provider runtime owns callback handling and token storage. The
  renderer sees URL host and pending/completed/failed status only.
- Claude Agent SDK's MCP OAuth requires the host to complete OAuth and pass an access token in
  headers, so that adapter advertises `integration.mcp.oauth` as unsupported under AgentDock's
  no-token posture. A provider-owned Claude CLI flow may advertise it only with separate evidence.
  See [Claude Agent SDK MCP OAuth](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/mcp#oauth2-authentication).
- Starting a stdio MCP server is code execution, even before a tool is called. Trust and manifest
  preview therefore apply to connection, not merely invocation.
- MCP inspection normalizes each configuration field as `public`, `secret`, or `unknown`.
  Environment, header, bearer-token, URL, client-secret, and OAuth-secret values are withheld. The
  current adapter classifies configured stdio `command` and `args` as public and returns them
  verbatim without inspecting embedded secrets; users and downstream clients must not place
  credentials there and must treat inspection output as sensitive configuration. Editing sends
  typed fields back through the owning provider.

The v1 CLI path spawns with a sanitized, default-deny environment (reviewed OS/runtime keys plus
the target provider's own documented auth-key mode), never the daemon's full environment, as
documented in
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#provider-subprocess-environment-isolation). That is a floor shared
with v2, not itself a v2 credential guarantee.

## Persistence, retention, and redaction

V1 event envelopes remain memory-only and can contain arbitrary `tool.started.input` and
`tool.completed.result` values; logger key redaction does not sanitize that replay buffer.
Compatibility `AgentSession` metadata is filesystem-backed but omits prompts and raw error
diagnostics. V2 persistence stores
only strict normalized envelopes, so raw tool inputs/results and approval response payloads are
rejected at the storage boundary.

V2 uses a per-user state directory with restrictive OS permissions -- re-verified on every startup
on POSIX, not just checked when the directory is first created (issue #67): an existing directory
we own but with a looser mode is corrected; an existing directory owned by a different local user
is refused with an actionable error rather than written into (`ensureStateDirectory()`,
`apps/daemon/src/state-directory.ts`; the temp-rooted discovery/token-handoff directory has its own
stricter always-refuse check, `ensureSecureRuntimeDir()` in `apps/daemon/src/discovery-file.ts`,
unchanged by this). It does not add application-layer encryption in this phase, so the UI and
documentation must describe the local plaintext-at-rest property.

User-controlled prompts, assistant-visible text, tool-selected files, and attachments may contain
pasted or embedded secrets. They are not treated as designated authentication fields and cannot be
reliably secret-scanned. They follow the content-retention policy above; a downstream product must
give users an appropriate warning before collecting sensitive content.

A lineage is its root session, every resume/fork descendant, and the tombstones required to preserve
those references. It is the eviction unit. Cleanup is transactional and may evict a lineage only
when every member is terminal and no execution or deletion lease is active. Before creating,
resuming, or forking, the daemon projects both global caps; it evicts eligible lineages first and,
if none can make room, returns a typed `storage_full` error before provider dispatch. It never
exceeds either cap. A single 500-session lineage cannot add a 501st member until the user exports
what they need and deletes that terminal lineage. Tombstones count toward both limits, so lineage
preservation cannot grow an unbounded side store.

If a value cannot be confidently classified, persist a bounded redaction summary rather than a
partial object. Retention cleanup is atomic and crash-safe. Corrupt records are quarantined rather
than interpreted or silently discarded, and their bytes continue to count toward the quota until
explicit deletion or successful repair.

## Live protocol and memory bounds

Limits apply after UTF-8 encoding unless a row explicitly says JavaScript string length. They are
validated at every renderer/preload, IPC, daemon, adapter, and persistence boundary; a narrower
provider limit wins.

JSON carries no inline binary; attachments use opaque handles and the separate byte quotas above.
Truncation never creates partial JSON, changes a command/approval target, or converts malformed data
into trusted content. If a reconnect sequence precedes `earliestSequence`, the daemon returns
`409 replay_gap`; the client must reload the current snapshot and cannot infer omitted events.
Approval and question deadlines are five minutes from successful publication to the responder; a
shorter provider deadline wins. Disconnect or publication failure resolves immediately, deadlines
use a monotonic clock, and neither user activity nor reconnect extends them.

## Approval and question resolution

Every provider request is bound to one `(sessionId, turnId, requestId)` tuple and moves exactly once
from `pending` to `allowed`, `denied`, `answered`, or `cancelled`. Exactly one normalized
resolution event is emitted. Each response command also has a client command ID: retrying the same
ID with a byte-equivalent canonical payload returns the recorded acknowledgement without forwarding
again. Reusing an ID with different content returns `409 command_id_conflict`; a new response to a
stale, cross-session, or post-terminal request returns `409 stale_interaction`.

The sole responder stream receives a per-connection 256-bit lease outside the event payload. Only
that live lease may authorize approval or question response commands; observer streams receive no
lease, and the Electron renderer receives neither the lease nor native correlation IDs.

- An approval that permits execution is forwarded only after the normalized audit record is
  durable. Timeout, responder disconnect, session interrupt, cancellation, or daemon shutdown
  resolves an approval to `denied`. If the audit write fails, AgentDock forwards a provider-native
  deny, returns `audit_failure` for the response command, and leaves the session active; it never
  converts an unaudited decision into permission to execute.
- A question timeout, responder disconnect, overflow, session interrupt, cancellation, or shutdown
  sends the provider-native cancel/no-answer response when supported, emits `cancelled`, and
  interrupts the current turn. The session becomes resumable only after the provider confirms it is
  idle; otherwise AgentDock cancels the session and emits its terminal event.
- Interrupt resolves every pending interaction for that turn before it is forwarded. Session cancel
  and daemon shutdown resolve all pending interactions before process cleanup. A restart marks any
  recovered active session `interrupted`; callbacks from the former process can never be resumed.
- A race is settled by the daemon's atomic compare-and-set of the pending record. The losing user,
  timeout, disconnect, or cancellation path observes the recorded resolution and performs no
  provider action.

Those audit-before-allow rules describe approvals initiated by an interactive provider session.

not append to `AuditStore`, and the production CLI MCP control plane reports direct invocation as
unsupported. Do not treat that standalone route as an audited destructive-action path until it is
wired through the same durable gate or disabled by policy.

## Transport fallback and accepted-work boundary

Fallback is a side-effect safety rule, not a timeout policy. Each adapter compatibility manifest
defines one tested boundary:

| Transport        | Replay becomes forbidden when                                               | Fallback rule                                                                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Codex app-server | The complete `turn/start` request is handed to app-server                   | No fallback after delivery; app-server exposes no documented idempotency/no-work proof     |
| Claude Agent SDK | `WarmQuery.query(prompt)` is invoked after an inert, successful `startup()` | No runtime fallback is wired after SDK selection; startup/query failure fails that session |
| Codex exec       | Process spawn is attempted (the prompt is then handed to stdin immediately) | No fallback after the spawn attempt; success/failure ambiguity cannot replay               |
| Claude CLI       | The first prompt byte is handed to child stdin                              | No fallback after any prompt delivery; partial-write failure is ambiguous                  |

- Codex probe, schema, handshake, or startup failure may fall back at most once when it occurs before
  the boundary and proves that no work was accepted. Claude `auto` can select the legacy CLI when an
  SDK eligibility gate fails before transport selection, but an import/startup failure after SDK
  selection is not replayed through the CLI. Starting a stdio MCP server or executing any startup
  hook would cross the no-replay boundary even before a model turn; the current SDK profile disables
  those sources.
- A fallback candidate must re-satisfy the exact provider account/auth source, model, required
  capabilities, workspace trust/source gates, sandbox profile, and retention scope. Claude SDK
  API/cloud authentication never falls back to a subscription-authenticated CLI. A
  rich/restricted transport never falls back to weaker v1 isolation.
- Timeout, disconnect, malformed response, or process loss after dispatch is ambiguous and never
  authorizes replay. The session ends failed/interrupted with one terminal event.
- Provider-native retries stay inside the selected transport and surface their status. They do not
  trigger a second transport or a fixed AgentDock fallback timer.
- The selected transport, compatibility evidence, accepted/not-accepted state, and fallback reason
  are non-secret session metadata.
- Cancellation, denial, and shutdown resolve pending requests before process cleanup. Every path
  preserves the v1 invariant of exactly one terminal event, always last.

## Threat walkthrough

| Scenario               | Required state                                                                                                                                                          | Default decision and enforcement                                                                                                               | Persisted evidence                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read-only code review  | Untrusted allowed only with project sources suppressed, `isolation.filesystem.workspace_read: enforced`, `isolation.filesystem.read_only: enforced`, and network denied | Provider-visible reads stay inside canonical workspace/approved runtime roots; any unknown tool or attempted escalation denies and ends safely | Safe summaries and normalized user/assistant content                                |
| File edit              | Trusted workspace, `isolation.filesystem.workspace_write: enforced`, exclusive mutation lease                                                                           | Show paths/diff; ask before write unless an exact bounded session grant exists                                                                 | Approval decision plus safe diff summary, not raw native payload                    |
| Shell command          | Trusted workspace, command effect, exclusive mutation lease                                                                                                             | Ask with normalized command/cwd/effects; timeout/disconnect denies                                                                             | Command summary, decision, exit status; raw output live-only unless classified safe |
| Network access         | Trusted workspace, `isolation.network.restricted: enforced`                                                                                                             | Ask for exact host/protocol/port; a generic command approval cannot grant network                                                              | Destination summary and decision; no headers/tokens                                 |
| Destructive MCP action | Trusted server/source, destructive effect, exclusive mutation lease                                                                                                     | Design requirement: `allow_once` only and durable audit before provider response; the standalone invoke route does not yet satisfy this gate   | Server/tool identity, safe target summary, decision; no raw arguments/result        |

These scenarios are the minimum policy cases exercised with the fake provider. Any failure to
classify the action uses the destructive row.

No downstream implementation may weaken a safe default because a provider exposes a more
permissive native option. A change to a decision-summary rule or catalog safe default requires an
explicit amendment to this document and a review of all dependent tickets.

## Non-goals

- Completing OS-isolation evidence, production MCP/component/subagent execution controls, or
  provider-executed attachment and structured-output workflows in this design document
- Storing credentials or building an AgentDock credential vault
- Marketplace browsing/installation or arbitrary hook editing/execution
- Treating permissions, worktrees, or Electron's renderer sandbox as OS process isolation
- Claiming parity between Claude and Codex, or between models/versions of one provider
- Emulating unsupported fork, structured output, sandbox, or provider features
- Cloud sync, remote workspaces, or multi-user isolation
