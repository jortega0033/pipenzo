# Daemon

`apps/daemon` is a standalone Fastify HTTP+SSE server. It has no Electron dependency and no
required parent process: `pnpm daemon` runs and can be `curl`'d directly, with no display server
or GUI test harness required.

## Running it standalone

```bash
pnpm daemon
```

This runs `apps/daemon/src/index.ts` directly through `tsx` (`pnpm --filter @agent-dock/daemon run
start`). On startup it prints the URL it's listening on and where it wrote its discovery file. In
another terminal:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:<port>/health
```

`pnpm --filter @agent-dock/daemon run dev` does the same thing with `tsx watch` for auto-restart on
source changes.

## Binding and port

The daemon binds `127.0.0.1` only, never `0.0.0.0`, and never the IPv6 loopback (`::1`) either; it
answers on IPv4 only (`apps/daemon/src/index.ts`). By default it asks the OS for an ephemeral port
(`AGENT_DOCK_PORT` unset or `0`); set `AGENT_DOCK_PORT=<port>` to request a fixed one. Whichever
port it ends up on is written to the discovery file and printed to stdout: there's no way to know
it in advance otherwise.

## Discovery file

The daemon writes `{ port, token, pid, startedAt }` to `os.tmpdir()/agent-dock/<app-id>.json` once
it's listening (the file mode `0600`, and the containing directory created/verified mode `0700`
on POSIX (see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#local-auth-token) for why, including the Windows
caveat)). This is a **filesystem handoff, not a network one**: a client reads the file directly
(it has to be running as the same OS user), rather than the daemon ever broadcasting the token
over the network.

`<app-id>` defaults to `agent-dock` and is set via `AGENT_DOCK_APP_ID`; see
[Duplicate-start behavior](#duplicate-start-behavior) below for why it exists and how it is
validated.

## Auth token

Every route except `GET /health` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, checked with a
timing-safe comparison. The full threat model and reasoning live in
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md); this file only covers operational behavior, not why it's safe.

## Duplicate-start behavior

The daemon refuses to start if its app id's discovery file's recorded pid is still alive
(`apps/daemon/src/discovery-file.ts#assertNoLiveDaemon`):

```
Error: another agent-dock daemon (app id "agent-dock") is already running (pid <pid>,
discovery file <path>). Only one daemon per app id is supported at a time. Stop it first.
```

This is a best-effort **per app id** check, not a machine-global or atomic lock.
`AGENT_DOCK_APP_ID` (default `agent-dock`) namespaces the discovery filename, so two different
products built on this boilerplate intentionally run their own daemons side by side. A sequential
second start with the same app id sees the live recorded pid and refuses to start. Two simultaneous
starts can both pass the pre-listen check before either writes the file, then coexist while the last
writer wins discovery. The packaged Electron app separately prevents its normal launch path with
`app.requestSingleInstanceLock()`; a standalone host needing a hard guarantee must add equivalent
coordination. The app id is
validated before it is used to build discovery and state-directory paths. Because both validators
run, the effective accepted set is 1–64 characters: a lowercase ASCII letter or digit first, then
lowercase ASCII letters, digits, `-`, or `_`. Invalid values are rejected outright (the daemon fails
to start with a clear error) rather than sanitized, so they cannot be used for path traversal or to
point outside the discovery directory.

A discovery file whose recorded pid is no longer running (a stale file left by a crash or
force-kill) is treated as safe to overwrite: nothing is listening at that pid anymore, and a
corrupt/partially-written file is treated the same way. A stale file for one app id never affects
another app id's daemon, since they're different files. See
[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md#daemon-fails-to-start) if you hit this unexpectedly.

Structured request bodies and identifiers use shared Zod schemas or narrow explicit validators;
raw attachment streams have route-specific byte, MIME, and quota checks. Invalid input gets a `4xx`
with a short JSON error message, never a stack trace. See the full request-validation and
error-handler behavior in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#request-validation).

Wire shapes (route bodies, the `AgentEvent`/`AgentEventEnvelope` format) are documented in
[protocol-v1.md](protocol-v1.md), not duplicated here.

Protocol v2 is additive: authenticated `/v2/providers` and `/v2/sessions` routes expose scoped
capability records, negotiate before starting provider work, stream validated v2 envelopes, and
dispatch accepted interactive commands through
`POST /v2/sessions/:sessionId/commands`. The unversioned routes above remain the v1 compatibility
and rollback path. The complete v2 route, status, and wire-shape tables live in
[protocol-v2.md](protocol-v2.md).

## Session admission

`POST /sessions` and `POST /v2/sessions` (including resume/fork) share one daemon-wide admission
gate (`apps/daemon/src/session-admission.ts`): at most `AGENT_DOCK_MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS` provider
processes pending-start-or-running at once, default 4, hard ceiling 32. An out-of-range or
non-integer value fails the daemon at startup rather than silently clamping. Past the limit, a new
session request gets `429 session_capacity_exceeded` immediately rather than queueing.

## Session lifecycle: SessionManager, SessionStore

`SessionManager` (`apps/daemon/src/session-manager.ts`) orchestrates both legacy and interactive
runtime handles: it creates sessions through the provider registry, consumes normalized event
streams, and keeps the `AgentSession` record's status current as terminal events arrive. The v2
facade owns the frozen capability selection, execution/turn IDs, normalized v2 replay window, and
v2 lifecycle projection.

The `AgentSession` record itself lives behind a `SessionStore` interface
(`apps/daemon/src/session-store.ts`):

```ts
interface SessionStore {
  create(session: AgentSession, protocolVersion?: 1 | 2): void;
  get(id: string): AgentSession | undefined;
  update(id: string, session: AgentSession): void;
  delete(id: string): void;
  list(): AgentSession[];
  protocolVersionOf(id: string): 1 | 2 | undefined;
}
```

`MemorySessionStore` remains available for isolated tests and embedders. Production uses the
versioned `FileSessionStore`, which atomically persists compatibility metadata without prompts or
raw error diagnostics and marks legacy active-at-restart records failed. Protocol v2 additionally
uses
`FileExecutionGraphStore` as the authoritative durable metadata/history store; it recovers active
executions as `interrupted` and owns lineage retention, tombstones, pagination, and continuation
locks. All writes remain synchronous so metadata is durable before provider dispatch.

The compatibility store owns only the `AgentSession` record. A session's live legacy or interactive
provider handle and bounded SSE replay window remain runtime state inside `SessionManager`; durable
normalized v2 events are stored separately by the execution graph.

For an interactive v2 transport, creation resolves only after the provider startup handshake. The
common supervisor enforces 1 MiB provider-frame and normalized-event limits, a 5,000-event / 16 MiB
provider queue, at most 32 pending interactions, 30-second startup/command acceptance, five-minute
interaction deadlines, a five-second graceful-close bound, mandatory process-tree hard-stop/reap
fallback, and exactly one terminal event. Provider stderr is drained and discarded; it is not a
retained diagnostic buffer. Production Claude exposes the pinned Agent SDK transport when its
asset/auth/trust gates pass; Codex exposes its version-validated app-server transport. `FakeProvider`
keeps this path deterministic in shared supervisor tests.

The manager registers each startup before awaiting that handshake. Client disconnect, direct
cancellation, cancel-all, and daemon shutdown abort and await pending starts; shutdown also closes
the admission gate before taking its cancellation snapshot. A provider must honor the startup
abort signal by reaping its host before rejecting.

Interactive command dispatch is serialized per session. A canonical command ID/payload retry
shares the original result; conflicting reuse returns `409 command_id_conflict`. Admission is
capped at 64 pending commands or 1 MiB of pending command JSON and returns
`429 session_backpressure` when full. The settled deduplication ledger retains at most 1,024
entries. `session.interrupt` invokes the transport's interrupt operation and keeps the session
available when supported; it is not cancellation or close.

## Event history and replay

`SessionManager` buffers every session's emitted `AgentEventEnvelope`s in memory, capped at 5,000
events **or** 16 MiB of serialized envelopes per session (`MAX_STORED_EVENTS_PER_SESSION`,
`MAX_STORED_EVENT_BYTES_PER_SESSION`), whichever is hit first. A single normalized v1 envelope over
1 MiB (`MAX_LEGACY_EVENT_ENVELOPE_BYTES`) fails the whole session with a synthetic
`session.failed` rather than being buffered or streamed. `GET /sessions/:id/events`:

1. Writes the standard `text/event-stream` headers, then an SSE `:ok` comment immediately.
2. Replays every buffered event from `sequence` 0 (or from `Last-Event-ID + 1`, if that header was
   sent) as `id: <sequence>\nevent: <type>\ndata: <json>\n\n` frames.
3. Keeps the connection open and streams new events live as they arrive.
4. Closes the response itself once a terminal event (`session.completed` / `session.failed` /
   `session.cancelled`) is written: the client never has to guess whether more events might still
   arrive.

Past the 5,000-event/16 MiB cap, further events are no longer available to replay to a _new_
subscriber. `sequence` is stamped from a counter independent of the history buffer's length, so it
keeps incrementing past the cap rather than resetting or gapping. The daemon logs a warning once
history stops growing, rather than growing memory unbounded. See
[protocol-v1.md#ordering-guarantees](protocol-v1.md#ordering-guarantees) for the full ordering
contract this upholds.

Live delivery to an already-connected subscriber is bounded too, by the same per-connection writer
v2 uses (`apps/daemon/src/sse-writer.ts`): each v1 SSE connection gets an independent 256-event /
4 MiB write queue (`apps/daemon/src/v1-sse-writer.ts`). A subscriber that falls behind past that
queue has its connection dropped and ended outright — v1 has no overflow frame to announce it
(unlike v2's `stream.error`/`stream_overflow` below), so a backpressured v1 client sees the
connection simply close, potentially before the terminal event. This is regression-tested in
`apps/daemon/test/session-manager.test.ts`.

Protocol v2 keeps a separate normalized replay window capped at 5,000 events or 16 MiB, evicting
oldest frames first. A resume cursor outside `[earliestSequence, nextSequence]` returns
`409 replay_gap`. Each connected v2 subscriber gets the same 256-event / 4 MiB write queue described
above. Backpressure on one connection cannot stall the provider or another subscriber. A terminal
event closes only after queued frames drain; subscriber overflow drops that connection's queue and
ends it with `stream.error` / `stream_overflow`, including the last sequence handed to the socket
when available.

## Session retention

Once a session reaches a terminal state, its runtime state (buffered event history, listener set)
isn't deleted immediately: a client that hasn't seen the terminal event yet still needs to
replay/receive it. But retaining every completed session forever would grow memory without bound
for a long-lived daemon whose client never calls `DELETE`, so `SessionManager` keeps only the most
recently completed 50 sessions' runtime state (`MAX_RETAINED_COMPLETED_RUNTIMES`), evicting the
oldest runtime once a 51st completes. For protocol v1, that eviction also deletes the compatibility
`AgentSession` record. Protocol v2's durable execution record/history follows the execution graph's
separate retention policy. This is a simple bound, not a cache-replacement policy. Calling
`DELETE /sessions/:id` removes a session immediately regardless of this cap and removes it from
retention tracking too.

`SessionManager.cancel()` also refuses to report success for a session that's already terminal
(see the routes table above), so a stale UI action against a long-finished session gets `404`, not
a misleading `202`.

This section covers only `SessionManager`'s in-memory runtime bound. The daemon's other durable
state -- the state directory's own POSIX permissions, the approval audit log's size/age rotation,
and staged attachments' quota/lineage/age cleanup -- is documented in
[capability-security-v2.md's retention table](capability-security-v2.md#persistence-retention-and-redaction),
which is the one place that table is kept, to avoid two docs drifting out of sync with each other.

## Cancellation and process-tree kill

`POST /sessions/:id/cancel` calls the session's runtime handle's `cancel()`, which kills the
provider CLI's whole process tree, not just the direct child, so a cancelled session can't leave
a grandchild process (e.g. a shell command the CLI itself launched) orphaned:

- **Windows**: the shipped Job Object host owns the provider tree with `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`;
  cancellation terminates and reaps that host, which closes the job and its descendants
- **POSIX**: the child is spawned detached in its own process group; cancellation sends
  `SIGTERM` to the group, then `SIGKILL` after a short grace period and verifies the group is gone
  within the bounded termination window

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#process-hygiene) for the verification split between the Windows
workflow, Linux CI, and unverified macOS behavior.
`DELETE /sessions/:id` cancels first (if the session is still `starting`/`running`) before removing
the record, so deleting a live session doesn't orphan its process either.

## Shutdown

On `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`, the daemon (`apps/daemon/src/index.ts`): cancels every in-flight session and
waits (bounded, 16 seconds by default, covering interactive graceful-close and force-reap phases)
for their processes to actually exit (`SessionManager.cancelAll()`), closes every open MCP stdio
connection (`closeAllMcpConnections()`), closes the Fastify server (bounded: 5 seconds, then
`closeAllConnections()` plus a further 1-second bound), removes the discovery file, then exits.
This is idempotent: a second signal while shutdown is already in progress is a no-op. The bounded
wait means shutdown won't hang forever if teardown stalls. Legacy cancellation awaits the owned
process-tree termination/reap operation; the interactive supervisor performs its own bounded
graceful-close and hard-stop fallback. The outer shutdown bound also covers pending starts and
terminal event consumption.

**Windows limitation**: Node's `child.kill()` maps to `TerminateProcess` on Windows, which does not
deliver a real `SIGTERM` the daemon's own shutdown handler can catch, so when Electron kills the
daemon child process directly (e.g. on app quit), the daemon's own `cancelAll()` above never runs
at all on that platform. Electron compensates by calling `POST /sessions/cancel-all` over HTTP
_before_ killing the daemon child process (HTTP is a request Windows can deliver reliably, unlike
a signal to the daemon's own process), and separately cancels each tracked interactive v2 session.
This covers every session the desktop main process started, not just the one the current UI happens
to be displaying. See `killDaemon()` in `apps/desktop/electron/main.ts` and
[architecture.md#known-limitations](architecture.md#known-limitations) for what this does and
doesn't cover on POSIX. The daemon process itself has always been confirmed to exit alongside the
app in testing; what can be left behind is a stale discovery file, which is harmless, see
[Duplicate-start behavior](#duplicate-start-behavior) above.

## Logging

`packages/agent-runtime/src/logger.ts`'s `createConsoleLogger` writes structured JSON lines to
stdout/stderr. Set `AGENT_DOCK_LOG_LEVEL=debug` to see `debug`-level lines (default is `info`). Any
log metadata key matching `/token|secret|password|authorization|api[-_]?key|credential/i` is
redacted to `[redacted]` regardless of level, see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#what-the-daemon-will-never-do).
