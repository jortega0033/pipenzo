This catalog is for downstream products built from AgentDock. It is not AgentDock's feature list or
delivery roadmap.

AgentDock is most useful as the supervised runtime inside a focused workflow product: inspect a
real workspace, show progress as normalized activity, pause before consequential actions where the
selected provider and transport support approvals, and produce a reviewable artifact with a durable
record of the approval decisions made along the way (see the
[capability matrix](../capability-matrix.md) for exactly which transports support what). A generic
chat window does not use enough of the boilerplate to be a strong product wedge.

## How to read the directory

The **Profile** column shows which part of AgentDock makes a concept stronger. The **Current
checkout** column names the implemented subset or downstream responsibility. Linked issues
[#15](https://github.com/jortega0033/agentdock/issues/15)-[#18](https://github.com/jortega0033/agentdock/issues/18)
are closed implementation tickets, not maturity or provider-parity guarantees. Verify the selected
branch, provider, platform, and fixture-backed capability before promising it downstream.

| Profile              | Current checkout                            | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core**             | Implemented; provider-scoped                | Provider-neutral v2 session lifecycle, streams, interaction routing, workspace trust, audit, durable history, and concurrency exist. Native execution, resume/fork, and interaction support are negotiated capabilities, not universal guarantees.                                                                                                        |
| **MCP**              | Control plane implemented; provider-limited | Daemon routes and normalized control-plane contracts exist. Current production CLI adapters expose only the configuration subset their providers support; live tool/resource/prompt catalogs, provider-owned OAuth, and direct invocation remain unavailable. See closed implementation ticket [#15](https://github.com/jortega0033/agentdock/issues/15). |
| **Extensions**       | Read-only discovery                         | Filesystem discovery can inspect supported skills, plugins, hooks, commands, and agents. The production adapter does not perform management actions or invocation. See closed implementation ticket [#16](https://github.com/jortega0033/agentdock/issues/16).                                                                                            |
| **Agents**           | Worktrees current; subagents scaffolded     | Worktree preview, create, list, and cleanup are implemented. Subagent graph storage and routes exist, but production provider events do not populate the graph and graph controls remain unsupported. See closed implementation ticket [#17](https://github.com/jortega0033/agentdock/issues/17).                                                         |
| **Files**            | Staging and validation only                 | File picking, upload staging, references, and standalone structured-output validation exist. Session creation has no attachment or output-schema field, so neither is dispatched to provider execution. See closed implementation ticket [#18](https://github.com/jortega0033/agentdock/issues/18).                                                       |
| **App layer**        | Downstream-only                             | Product-specific work that AgentDock does not supply: accounts, cloud sync, domain data, licensed content, connectors, evaluations, billing, and distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Regulated review** | Downstream-only                             | A qualified domain reviewer, documented evaluations, and stricter release/action gates are required; AgentDock does not provide the compliance program.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Important boundaries:

- A local daemon is not the same as an offline or local-model product. Prompts, selected file
  contents, and tool results can still reach the chosen provider under that provider's policy.
- Provider credentials stay in provider-owned or inherited environments, but every downstream
  product still needs a data-flow and retention review.
- High-stakes legal, medical, financial, employment, security, or compliance concepts should
  prepare evidence and recommendations for a qualified reviewer, not make autonomous decisions.
- MCP servers, repository instructions, hooks, plugins, websites, emails, and documents are all
  potentially untrusted inputs. Keep least privilege and explicit approval at the action boundary.
- AgentDock is fork-oriented boilerplate, not a hosted business backend or a set of public npm
  packages.

## What the research says

The external sources validate workflow shapes, not each product idea. Vendor-reported results are
directional evidence and should not be treated as independent market sizing.

## Editorial shortlist

This ranking favors concepts that benefit from local workspace access, long-running or parallel
work, a natural approval boundary, inspectable evidence, and a small first integration surface.
The score is an editorial fit score, not market data.

## Concept directory

### 1. Agent infrastructure and software delivery

The crowded generic-coding category is still a useful foundation, but the more defensible wedges
are a particular stack, risk regime, migration, or review gate.

### 6. Customer, revenue, proposals, and content operations

External communication creates reputational and regulatory risk. The first product version should

### 7. Vertical and prosumer workbenches

These are narrower applications of the same case-desk, review-queue, and evidence-room patterns.
The vertical data model and evaluation set—not the system prompt—should become the product moat.

## Deeper source map by concept family

These primary sources expose the rules, schemas, APIs, or evidence structures that make a focused
agent workflow more than a prompt wrapper:

- **Software delivery:** [NIST SSDF](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final) defines a
  common secure-development practice vocabulary; GitHub exposes machine-readable
  [SBOM exports](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/establish-provenance-and-integrity/export-dependencies-as-sbom)
  and [check-run annotations and actions](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/using-the-rest-api-to-interact-with-checks).
- **Security and AI governance:** [NIST CSF 2.0](https://www.nist.gov/publications/nist-cybersecurity-framework-csf-20)
  provides outcome and profile structures, while the
  [NIST AI RMF](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework) provides a vocabulary for
  governing and measuring AI risk.
- **Incident and infrastructure operations:** [NIST SP 800-61r3](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3/final)
  covers incident-response integration with risk management; Kubernetes documents structured
  [audit records](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/) for correlating
  actors, requests, resources, and outcomes.
- **Privacy and records:** the European Commission documents how organizations should handle
  [individual data-rights requests](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/information-business-and-organisations/dealing-requests-individuals_en),
  NIST publishes a [Privacy Framework](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework), and NARA describes
  [records inventory and disposition](https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/scheduling/implementation).
- **Finance and structured documents:** [Peppol BIS Billing](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/bis/)
  exposes staged syntax, business-rule, and national-rule validation; the SEC provides
  [EDGAR filing and XBRL APIs](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/edgar-application-programming-interfaces).
- **Content and catalog quality:** standards such as
  [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), [XLIFF 2.1](https://www.oasis-open.org/standard/xliffv2-1/),
  and the [GS1 Global Data Model](https://www.gs1.org/standards/gs1-global-data-model) give agents
  deterministic checks and controlled schemas around otherwise subjective review work.
- **Bids and grants:** official APIs exist for
  [TED procurement notices](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/api/latest/search.html),
  [SAM.gov opportunities](https://open.gsa.gov/api/get-opportunities-public-api/), and
  [Grants.gov](https://www.grants.gov/api), making discovery and amendment tracking plausible
  while keeping pursue/pass and submission decisions human-owned.

## A reusable product anatomy

Most of the concepts above can share the same product skeleton:

1. **Intake:** one folder, case, issue, alert, transaction, or document set enters a bounded session.
2. **Plan:** the agent states its steps, requested capabilities, data sources, and expected artifact.
3. **Activity:** progress appears as a structured timeline of normalized events; whether it also
   carries source/tool provenance a user can audit depends on what the product layer adds on top.
4. **Gate:** questions and consequential actions enter an explicit human review queue, on the
   transports that support approvals (see the [capability matrix](../capability-matrix.md)).
5. **Action:** approved tools operate only within the selected workspace and integration scope.
6. **Verification:** the agent reruns checks and separates observed facts from inference.
7. **Artifact:** the product exports a diff, matrix, brief, workpaper, issue, or action packet.
8. **Memory:** durable lineage and history exist for every session; resume and fork are negotiated
   capabilities that vary by provider and transport, and the durable audit record covers approval
   decisions specifically, not a general activity log (see the
   [capability matrix](../capability-matrix.md)).

This skeleton is a better starting point than preserving the reference desktop's generic composer.
Replace the composer with the domain intake form, the provider panel with policy-aware defaults,
and the raw timeline with domain-specific evidence and approval cards.

## Choosing what to build

Score a candidate workflow from 0-2 on each question:

- Does it happen repeatedly for a clearly identified user?
- Does the work live in local files, repositories, or desktop-accessible tools?
- Is there a bounded case with an observable “done” state?
- Can the agent show evidence and run verification instead of merely sounding plausible?
- Is there a natural approval boundary before expensive or irreversible action?
- Can the first version use one input source, one action integration, and one artifact type?
- Are past cases available to create deterministic fixtures and outcome evaluations?
- Will workflow knowledge, policy, or proprietary data create differentiation beyond the model?

Prefer concepts scoring at least 12/16. Start with **draft → review → approved action**, and add
autonomy only after measured reliability justifies a narrower approval policy.

## Keeping the directory current

- Recheck the linked sources and product landscape every 6-12 months.
- Update capability tags and statuses when runtime behavior or capability manifests change. Treat
  [Epic #4](https://github.com/jortega0033/agentdock/issues/4) and closed implementation tickets
  [#15](https://github.com/jortega0033/agentdock/issues/15)-[#18](https://github.com/jortega0033/agentdock/issues/18)
  as historical implementation context, not the current maturity source.
- Add customer-interview evidence separately from vendor product evidence.
- Promote a concept into its own page only after it has a named persona, repeated job, first
  integration, evaluation set, approval policy, and explicit non-goals.
